   ```python
   # Exact Google Sheets Formula Implementation
   def calculate_mortgage(self, purchase_price, down_payment_pct, interest_rate):
       down_payment = purchase_price * down_payment_pct
       loan_amount = purchase_price - down_payment
       monthly_payment = PMT(interest_rate/12, 30*12, -loan_amount)
       return {down_payment, loan_amount, monthly_payment}
   ```

2. **Property Sourcing Engine** (`src/property_sourcer.py`)
   - Real-time data ingestion from multiple sources
   - Automated property filtering and ranking
   - Client-specific goal matching

3. **Interactive Dashboard** (`src/automated_dashboard.py`)
   - Real-time analysis and visualization
   - Scenario comparison tools
   - Optimization opportunity display

### Accuracy Assurance

       sources = ['MLS', 'Zillow', 'Realtor.com', 'Local Databases']
       for source in sources:
           properties = collect_properties(source)
           validate_and_store(properties)
   ```

2. **Real-Time Processing**
   - Continuous data validation
   - Automated quality scoring
   - Market condition monitoring

3. **Client Goal Matching**
   ```python
   # Client-specific deal identification
   def identify_top_deals(client_goals):
       for property in properties:
           score = calculate_deal_score(property, client_goals)
           if score > threshold:
               add_to_recommendations(property)
   ```

### Deal Identification Criteria

1. **Cash-on-Cash Return Optimization**
   - Minimum CoC thresholds per client
   - Risk-adjusted return calculations
   - Market condition adjustments

2. **Total Return Maximization**
