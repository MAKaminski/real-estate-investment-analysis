# Real Estate Investment Analysis Tool - Cursor Rules

## Project Overview
This is a comprehensive real estate investment analysis tool that calculates four key return metrics:
1. Cash on Cash Return
2. Appreciation Return  
3. Tax Savings Return
4. Principal Paydown Return

## Project Structure
- `src/` - All Python source code and configuration files
- `output/` - Generated analysis files (Excel, CSV, reports)
- Root level entry points for easy execution

## Key Files
- `main.py` - Main entry point for the analysis tool
- `run_example.py` - Example analysis with sample data
- `test_installation.py` - Installation verification
- `dashboard.py` - Web dashboard entry point
- `setup.py` - Setup and installation script

## Core Modules (in src/)
- `data_collector.py` - Property data collection from APIs and web scraping
- `financial_calculator.py` - Financial calculations and return metrics
- `data_processor.py` - Data processing and export functionality
- `config.py` - Configuration settings and constants
- `dashboard.py` - Web-based visualization dashboard

## Usage Patterns
- Command line: `python main.py --locations "Dallas, TX" --target-count 1000`
- Example: `python run_example.py`
- Testing: `python test_installation.py`
- Dashboard: `python dashboard.py`

## Financial Assumptions
- 20% down payment
- 6.5% interest rate (30-year fixed)
- 3% annual appreciation
- 25% tax rate
- Various expense ratios for property management, insurance, etc.

## Investment Criteria
- $20M monthly deployment capacity
- $100K-$300K property price range
- 5% yield rate (properties that fit buy box)
- 1,000+ properties analyzed per run

## Output Formats
- Excel (.xlsx) with multiple sheets
- CSV for simple data export
- Text reports with analysis summaries
- Interactive web dashboard

## Context Rules
- Always consider the financial calculations when modifying code
- Maintain the four return metrics structure
- Keep the large-scale analysis capability (1000+ properties)
- Preserve the investment criteria and assumptions
- Ensure all paths reference the src/ directory structure
- Use the launch.json configurations for debugging
